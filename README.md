Problem 1: The Two Sneaky Numbers of Digitville (Leet Code No. 3289) --- Beats 100% --- 1ms

Desc: In the town of Digitville, there was a list of numbers called nums containing integers from 0 to n - 1. Each number was supposed to appear exactly once in the list, however, two mischievous numbers sneaked in an additional time, making the list longer than usual. As the town detective, your task is to find these two sneaky numbers. Return an array of size two containing the two numbers (in any order), so peace can return to Digitville.

Problem 2: Next Greater Element I (Leet Code No. 496) --- Beats 98.91% --- 2ms

Desc: The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array. You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2. For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1. Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.

Problem 3: Cells in a Range on an Excel Sheet (Leet Code No.2194) --- Beats 100% --- 1ms

Desc: A  cell (r, c) of an excel sheet is represented as a string "<col><row>" where: <col> denotes the column number c of the cell. It is represented by alphabetical letters. For example, the 1st column is denoted by 'A', the 2nd by 'B', the 3rd by 'C', and so on. <row> is the row number r of the cell. The rth row is represented by the integer r. You are given a string s in the format "<col1><row1>:<col2><row2>", where <col1> represents the column c1, <row1> represents the row r1, <col2> represents the column c2, and <row2> represents the row r2, such that r1 <= r2 and c1 <= c2. Return the list of cells (x, y) such that r1 <= x <= r2 and c1 <= y <= c2. The cells should be represented as strings in the format mentioned above and be sorted in non-decreasing order first by columns and then by rows.
